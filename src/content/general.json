We believe in a holistic approach to crime prevention and work in partnership with the City of Oakland to address ongoing problems in our neighborhoods.\n \nMonthly meetings will be attended by a Community Resource Officer (CRO) – a specifically-designated OPD officer whose position is funded by <a href=\"https://cao-94612.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/MZ__2018-Policing-Eval-Year-2.pdf\">Measure Z</a>. Any community member (lives, works, or worships in 10Y) who wishes to regularly attend and participate in meetings is also welcome to join by signing up <a href=\"https://forms.gle/doTCnAGyMq8FRHh39\">here</a>. We will often have speakers from the city or community lined up for our meetings.",
