We believe in a holistic approach to crime prevention and work in partnership with the City of Oakland to address ongoing problems in our neighborhoods.\n \nMonthly meetings will be attended by a Community Resource Officer (CRO) – a specifically-designated OPD officer whose position is funded by <a href=\"https://cao-94612.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/MZ__2018-Policing-Eval-Year-2.pdf\">Measure Z</a>.

      "title": "Disclaimer: Why reporting a problem is important.",
      "info": "For many people, reporting a problem is an obvious first step to solving that problem. However, due to increasing distrust of city services, many people in Oakland are hesitant to involve the city (e.g., the police). Our NC recognizes this reality, but on principle, we take a data-driven approach to understanding what problems our neighborhood is facing. How can we solve a problem if we do not know it exists?\\nWhether or not you, personally, believe in the current form of policing in US cities, we urge you to find a constructive way to report the obstacles you are encountering. We will work to create multiple options for you and to build a cohesive accounting of what happens in 10Y. This section is a living document that represents our current understanding of how best to report problems Longfellow and Santa Fe neighbors encounter."
